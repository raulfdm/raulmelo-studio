### Environment variable

To be able to see and use `/search` page, it's necessary some algolia environment variable.

Create a file called `.env.local` with the following data:

```shell
# Those will be public
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_APP_ID=xxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_KEY=xxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=xxx
```
